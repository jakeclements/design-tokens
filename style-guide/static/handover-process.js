  "subtext1": "At OpenTable, we don’t believe in a final hand-off to engineers during the product development process. We believe that ongoing collaboration between engineers and designers is crucial to ensuring user-friendly and effective experiences.",
  "subtext2": "This is a guide for engineers and designers on when and what to do to make working together seamless and productive.",
  "phase1": "Phase 1",
  "phase1.header": "Gain context and ensure alignment",
  "phase1.subheader1": "Get involved in the product brief",
  "phase1.description1": "A product manager will write and share a product brief at the start of the project. As a designer or engineer, you should feel welcome to review and provide feedback on all parts of the brief.  During development, continue to review the brief and designs to ensure you and all team members have a clear understanding of customer needs.",
  "phase1.subheader2": "Align on vision with Story Mapping",
  "phase1.description2.1": "To ensure your team is aligned on workflows and outcomes, you can run a story mapping exercise.",
  "phase1.description2.2": "Story mapping is a practice of quickly building shared understanding and encouraging product, design, engineering and other stakeholders to define and prioritize the work. The exercise is helpful early in the process as a delivery tool, to support release planning and identify workflows without the need for designs.",
  "phase1.description2.3":"If the engineering group is small and there’s time, you can choose to involve all engineers in discussion. However to save time, the PM and designer can outline the user flow and slices and then review and iterate with engineer leads."
